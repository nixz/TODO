     ** Introduction to time management.
     * Setting and Priotitizing goals
     ** Setting Goals
        - long term > month
        - short term < month
        - Relistic and Challenging
        - Specific
        - Time-limited
        - Measurable
        - Break down longer term goals into smaller tasks
        - Set goals in all areas. You'll feel better more productive and reduce
          stress
     ** Prioritizing Goals
        - Urgency
        - Importance
        - Achieve one with highest priority
        - Make a 4 categories
        - Important + Urgent (Do it now)
        - ~Important + Urgent (requires immediate response)
        - ~Important + ~Urgent (delegate if possible)
        - Spend most time in (Important + ~Urgent). It has long term impact on your
          job, career or business.
        - Imprtant + ~Urgent
          . Long-range planning
          . Customer/Client contact.
          . Participation in professional organization
